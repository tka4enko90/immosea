<h3>Notice for consumers on the cancellation of contracts for the supply of digital content that is not supplied on a physical medium (e.g. an e-book or a software download)</h3>

<strong>Cancellation policy</strong>

A consumer is any natural person who completes a legal transaction for purposes that are for the most part not attributable to any professional activity of either a commercial or self-employed nature they engage in.

<strong>Right of cancellation</strong>

You have the right to cancel this contract without giving reasons within a fourteen-day cancellation period that begins on the day on which the contract is concluded. In order to exercise your right of cancellation you must notify us ([please insert: name/company, address of cancellation recipient, telephone number, email address, fax number (if you have one); you can also use the shortcode [woocommerce_de_disclaimer_address_data] and save the address in your EN settings]) of your decision to cancel this contract by means of an unequivocal declaration (e.g. in the form of a letter sent by post, a fax or an email). You can - but are not required to - use the cancellation form template appended to this cancellation policy. You will be deemed to have complied with the aforementioned cancellation period if your letter, fax or email notifying us of the use of your right of cancellation was sent prior to the expiry of the cancellation period.

<strong>Consequences of cancellation</strong>
If you cancel this contract we are required to pay back all payments we have received from you (including delivery costs but excluding additional costs incurred as a result of you selecting a different delivery type to the standard, lowest cost delivery type we offer) without delay and within a maximum period of fourteen days from the date on which we receive your correspondence notifying us of your cancellation of this contract. Repayment occurs using the same payment type you used for the original transaction unless otherwise agreed with you; you will not be charged any fees in connection with repayment.

<strong>Exclusion and premature expiry of the right of cancellation</strong>
The right of cancellation does not apply to contracts for the supply of digital content that is not prefabricated and whose fabrication is either defined by the options selected and purposes intended by the consumer or clearly tailored to the consumer's personal requirements. The right of cancellation expires prematurely if we only commence the performance of the contract after you grant your express consent and thus confirm your awareness of the fact that you lose your right of cancellation upon such time as we commence the performance of the contract. We point out that we are entitled to make the aforementioned consent and confirmation a prerequisite for the conclusion of the contract.
