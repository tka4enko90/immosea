<h3 id="m13">Relevant legal bases</h3>
In the following, we provide the legal basis of the basic data protection regulation (GDPR), on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence and domicile. If, in addition, more specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a. GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given his/her consent to the processing of personal data relating to him/her for one or more specific purposes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Contract performance and pre-contractual enquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b. GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</li>
 	<li><strong>Legal obligation (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c. GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.</li>
 	<li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter f. GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary in order to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="m27">Security measures</h2>
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection commensurate with the risk.

Such measures shall include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, input, disclosure, safeguarding of availability and segregation of data relating to them. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure that data subjects' rights are exercised, data is deleted, and responses are made to any threats to the data. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and processes in accordance with the principle of data protection, by designing technology and by using data protection-friendly default settings.

<strong>SSL encryption (https)</strong>: To protect your data transmitted via our online offer, we use SSL encryption. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address line of your browser.

<span style="color: red;">Note: Remove the reference to encryption if your listing is not encrypted. However, delivery of the website via https should be considered mandatory.</span>
<h2 id="m25">Transmission and disclosure of personal data</h2>
In the course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to or disclosed to other bodies, companies, legally independent organisational units or persons. The recipients of this data may include, for example, payment institutions in the context of payment transactions, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases we observe the legal requirements and in particular conclude appropriate contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data which serve to protect your data.
<h2 id="m24">Data processing in third countries</h2>
If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if the processing takes place in the context of the use of services of third parties or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this will only take place in accordance with the legal requirements.

Subject to express consent or transmission required by contract or by law, we will only process or allow data to be processed in third countries with a recognised level of data protection, contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission, where certifications or binding internal data protection regulations exist (Art. 44 to 49 GDPR, information page of the EU Commission: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de</a> ).
<h2 id="m134">use of cookies</h2>
Cookies are text files that contain data from visited websites or domains and are stored by a browser on the user's computer. A cookie is primarily used to store information about a user during or after his visit within an online offer. The stored information may include, for example, the language settings on a website, the login status, a shopping cart or the location where a video was viewed. The term "cookies" also includes other technologies that perform the same functions as cookies (e.g., when user information is stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, also referred to as "user IDs")

<strong>The following cookie types and functions are distinguished:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Temporary cookies (also: session or session cookies):</strong> Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offer and closed his browser.</li>
 	<li><strong>Permanent cookies:</strong> Permanent cookies remain stored even after closing the browser. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. Likewise, the interests of users used for reach measurement or marketing purposes can be stored in such a cookie.</li>
 	<li><strong>First-Party-Cookies:</strong> First-party cookies are set by ourselves.</li>
 	<li><strong>Third-Party-Cookies:</strong> Third party cookies are mainly used by advertisers (so-called third parties) to process user information.</li>
 	<li><strong>Necessary (also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies:</strong> Cookies may be absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to store logins or other user entries or for security reasons).</li>
 	<li><strong>Statistical, marketing and personalization cookies</strong>: In addition, cookies are generally also used in the context of range measurement and when the interests of a user or his behaviour (e.g. viewing certain content, using functions etc.) on individual web pages are stored in a user profile. Such profiles are used to show users e.g. content that corresponds to their potential interests. This procedure is also known as "tracking", i.e. following the potential interests of users. . If we use cookies or "tracking" technologies, we will inform you separately in our privacy policy or when you give your consent.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Notes on legal bases: </strong> The legal basis on which we process your personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask you for your consent. If this is the case and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for processing your data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the aid of cookies will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in the business operation of our online offer and its improvement) or, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations.

<strong>Storage duration: </strong>Unless we provide you with explicit information on the storage duration of permanent cookies (e.g. within the framework of a so-called cookie opt-in), please assume that the storage duration can be up to two years.

<strong>General information on withdrawal and opposition (opt-out): </strong> Depending on whether the processing is based on consent or legal permission, you may at any time revoke any consent you have given or object to the processing of your data by cookie technologies (collectively referred to as "opt-out"). You can initially declare your objection by means of the settings of your browser, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies (although this may also restrict the functionality of our online service). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared by means of a variety of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the websites <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info">https://optout.aboutads.info</a> and <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/">https://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>. In addition, you can receive further notices of objection in the context of the information on the service providers and cookies used.

<strong>Processing of cookie data based on consent</strong>: Before we process or allow data to be processed in the context of the use of cookies, we ask users for their consent, which can be revoked at any time. Before the consent has not been given, cookies are used if necessary, which are absolutely necessary for the operation of our online offer.

<strong>Cookie settings/confirmation:</strong>

<span style="color: red;">If you are using a cookie consent banner (which is recommended), you can enter the option to call it up here (e.g. link or a so-called [short code], which is automatically converted into a button/link by your software).</span>
<ul class="m-elements">
 	<li><strong>Processed data types:</strong> Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).</li>
 	<li><strong>Persons concerned:</strong> Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).</li>
 	<li><strong>Legal basis:</strong> Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter a. GDPR), legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter f. GDPR).</li>
</ul>
<span style="color: red;">Notes on the processing of cookie data on the basis of consent: You should only leave this option (and otherwise delete it) if you have a "real" opt-in, i.e., if you obtain the consent of users to the use of cookies (e.g., with so-called "cookie consent / content/ opt-in banners" or as part of a registration procedure).</span>

<span style="color: red;">Since, according to the ECJ, a cookie opt-in is usually necessary when using marketing tools frequently used in e-commerce (e.g. Google Analytics or Facebook pixels), this option is pre-selected.</span>

<span style="color: red;">This means that until users have given their consent, you do not use cookies (and do not use third-party services within your websites, which in turn use cookies themselves). The use of necessary cookies that are expected by the users, such as a shopping basket function in the online shop or local range measurement with the Matomo tool, is permitted at most.</span>
<h2 id="m317">Commercial and business services</h2>
We process data of our contractual and business partners, e.g. customers and prospective customers (collectively referred to as "contractual partners") within the scope of contractual and comparable legal relationships as well as associated measures and within the scope of communication with the contractual partners (or pre-contractual), e.g. to answer inquiries.

We process this data for the purpose of fulfilling our contractual obligations, securing our rights and for the purposes of the administrative tasks associated with this information and for the purposes of the company's business organisation. Within the framework of the applicable law, we only pass on the data of the contractual partners to third parties to the extent that this is necessary for the aforementioned purposes or to fulfil legal obligations or with the consent of the persons concerned (e.g. to involved telecommunications, transport and other auxiliary services as well as subcontractors, banks, tax and legal advisors, payment service providers or tax authorities). The contractual partners will be informed about other forms of processing, e.g. for marketing purposes, within the scope of this data protection declaration.

We will inform the contractual partners which data is required for the above-mentioned purposes before or within the scope of data collection, e.g. in online forms, by means of special marking (e.g. colours) or symbols (e.g. asterisks or similar), or personally.

We delete the data after expiry of legal warranty and comparable obligations, i.e., in principle after 4 years, unless the data is stored in a customer account, e.g., as long as it must be kept for legal archiving reasons (e.g., for tax purposes usually 10 years). We will delete data that has been disclosed to us by the contractual partner within the scope of an order in accordance with the specifications of the order, generally after the end of the order.

If we use third-party providers or platforms to provide our services, the terms and conditions and data protection information of the respective third-party providers or platforms apply in the relationship between the users and the providers.

<strong>Customer account</strong>: Contracting parties can create an account within our online offer (e.g. customer or user account, in short "customer account"). If the registration of a customer account is required, contractual partners are informed of this as well as of the information required for registration. The customer accounts are not public and cannot be indexed by search engines. Within the scope of registration and subsequent logins and use of the customer account, we store the IP addresses of the customers together with the access times in order to be able to prove the registration and prevent possible misuse of the customer account.

If customers have cancelled their customer account, the data concerning the customer account will be deleted, subject to the retention of such data being required for legal reasons. It is the responsibility of the customers to secure their data when the customer account is cancelled.

<strong>Economic analyses and market research</strong>: For business management reasons and in order to be able to identify market trends, wishes of contractual partners and users, we analyse the data available to us on business transactions, contracts, enquiries, etc., whereby the group of persons concerned may include contractual partners, interested parties, customers, visitors and users of our online offer.

The analyses are carried out for the purpose of business management evaluations, marketing and market research (e.g. to determine customer groups with different characteristics). In doing so, we can, if available, take into account the profiles of registered users including their details, e.g. on services used. The analyses serve solely to serve us and are not disclosed externally, unless they are anonymous analyses with summarised, i.e. anonymised, values. Furthermore, we respect the privacy of the users and process the data for analysis purposes as pseudonymously as possible and, if feasible, anonymously (e.g. as summarized data).

<strong>Shop and e-commerce</strong>: We process the data of our customers in order to enable them to select, purchase or order the selected products, goods and related services, as well as their payment and delivery or execution. If necessary for the execution of an order, we use service providers, in particular postal, forwarding and shipping companies, in order to carry out the delivery or execution for our customers. For the processing of payment transactions we use the services of banks and payment service providers. The required information is marked as such within the scope of the order or comparable acquisition process and includes the information required for delivery, or provision and invoicing, as well as contact information in order to be able to make any necessary arrangements.
<ul class="m-elements">
 	<li><strong>Processed data types:</strong> Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses), payment data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history), contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers), contract data (e.g. subject matter of contract, duration, customer category), usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).</li>
 	<li><strong>Persons concerned:</strong> Interested parties, business and contractual partners, customers.</li>
 	<li><strong>Purpose of the processing:</strong> Provision of contractual services and customer service, contact enquiries and communication, office and organisational procedures, management and response to enquiries, security measures, visitor action evaluation, interest based and behavioural marketing, profiling (creation of user profiles)</li>
 	<li><strong>Legal basis:</strong> Fulfilment of contract and pre-contractual enquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b. GDPR), Legal obligation (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c. GDPR), Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f. GDPR)</li>
</ul>
<span style="color: red;">Note: Please remove the passage to the customer account or analysis of the customer data if you do not offer a customer account or do not analyze the data of your customers as described.</span>
<h2 id="m326">Payment service provider</h2>
Within the scope of contractual and other legal relationships, due to legal obligations or otherwise based on our legitimate interests, we offer the persons concerned efficient and secure payment options and use other payment service providers in addition to banks and credit institutions (collectively "payment service providers").

The data processed by the payment service providers include inventory data, such as name and address, bank data, such as account or credit card numbers, passwords, TANs and checksums, as well as contract, sum and recipient related data. These details are required to carry out the transactions. However, the data entered is only processed by the payment service providers and stored by them. This means that we do not receive any account or credit card-related information, but only information with confirmation or negative information about the payment. Under certain circumstances, the payment service providers may transfer the data to credit agencies. The purpose of this transmission is to check identity and creditworthiness. In this regard we refer to the General Terms and Conditions and the data protection information of the payment service providers.

For payment transactions, the terms and conditions and the data protection information of the respective payment service providers apply, which can be accessed within the respective websites or transaction applications. We also refer to these for further information and the assertion of rights of revocation, information and other rights of affected persons.
<ul class="m-elements">
 	<li><strong>Data types processed:</strong> Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses), payment data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history), contract data (e.g. subject matter of contract, duration, customer category), usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses)</li>
 	<li><strong>Persons concerned:</strong> Customers, prospects.</li>
 	<li><strong>The purposes of the processing:</strong> Provision of contractual services and customer service.</li>
 	<li><strong>Legal bases:</strong> Fulfilment of contract and pre-contractual enquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b. GDPR), legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f. GDPR)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Used services and service providers:</strong>
<ul class="m-elements">
 	<li><strong>PayPal:</strong> Payment services and solutions (e.g. PayPal, PayPal Plus, Braintree); service providers: PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg; Website: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/de">https://www.paypal.com/de</a>; Privacy policy: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full</a>.</li>
</ul>
<span style="color: red;">Otherwise adjust the list of services and providers as required. </span>
<h2 id="m325">Credit assessment</h2>
If we make advance payments or take comparable commercial risks (e.g. when ordering on account), we reserve the right to obtain identity and creditworthiness information for the purpose of assessing the credit risk on the basis of mathematical-statistical procedures from service companies specialising in this area (credit agencies) in order to safeguard legitimate interests.

We process the information received from the credit agencies about the statistical probability of a payment default within the scope of a proper discretionary decision on the establishment, execution and termination of the contractual relationship. We reserve the right to refuse payment on account or any other advance payment in the event of a negative result of the credit assessment.

The decision whether to make advance payment is made in accordance with Art. 22 GDPR solely on the basis of an automated decision in the individual case, which is made by our software on the basis of information from the credit agency.

If we obtain the express consent of contractual partners, the legal basis for credit information and the transmission of the customer's data to the credit agencies is consent. If consent is not obtained, the creditworthiness information will be based on our legitimate interest in the reliability of our payment claims.
<ul class="m-elements">
 	<li><strong>Data types processed:</strong> Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses), payment data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history), contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers), contract data (e.g. subject of contract, duration, customer category).</li>
 	<li><strong>Persons concerned:</strong> Customers, prospects.</li>
 	<li><strong>Purpose of the processing:</strong> Assessment of creditworthiness and solvency.</li>
 	<li><strong>Legal basis:</strong> Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter a. GDPR), legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 letter f. GDPR).</li>
 	<li><strong>Automated decisions in individual cases:</strong>  Credit information (decision based on a credit assessment).</li>
</ul>
<strong>Used services and service providers:</strong>
<ul class="m-elements">
 	<li><strong>Verband der Vereine Creditreform e.V:</strong> Wirtschaftsauskunftei; service provider: Verband der Vereine Creditreform e.V., Hellersbergstraße 12, D-41460 Neuss, Germany; Website: <a href="https://www.creditreform.de/">https://www.creditreform.de/</a>; Privacy policy: <a href="https://www.creditreform.de/datenschutz">https://www.creditreform.de/datenschutz</a>.</li>
</ul>
<span style="color: red;">Note: Remove the credit check passage if you do not perform a credit check. Check and change the list of service providers if necessary. You can check the creditworthiness of a customer if there is otherwise a risk of payment default, that is, if the goods are delivered without payment having been received (that is, if the customer chooses to buy on account). On the other hand, there is no risk of non-payment if the customer chooses, for example, the prepayment option or makes the payment via third-party providers such as Paypal. </span>

<span style="color: red;">It should also be noted that obtaining automatic creditworthiness information constitutes an "automated decision in individual cases" pursuant to Art. 22 GDPR, i.e. a legal decision without human involvement. This is permissible if the customer has consented or if this decision is necessary for the conclusion of the contract. Whether the decision is necessary has not yet been conclusively clarified, but is often taken as given, even by the author of this sample. </span>

<span style="color: red;">However, if you want to exclude any risk, you should obtain consent. Consent is also necessary if the credit report is already being used to decide whether the option "on account" should be shown at all. This is because it could have been that the customer would have chosen prepayment or Paypal anyway and the credit check would not have been necessary. Such a consent could for example be as follows: </span>

<span style="color: red;"><em> I agree that a credit assessment will be carried out in order to decide in an automated procedure (Art. 22 GDPR) whether the option of purchase on account is offered. Further information on the credit assessment, the credit agencies used and the procedure as well as the possibilities of appeal can be found in our [Link]Privacy Policy[/Link]..</em></span>
<h2 id="m225">Provision of the online offer and web hosting</h2>
In order to provide our online services securely and efficiently, we use the services of one or more web hosting providers from whose servers (or servers managed by them) the online services can be accessed. For these purposes, we may use infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage space and database services, and security and technical maintenance services.

The data processed within the framework of the provision of the hosting offer may include all data relating to the users of our online offer, which are generated within the framework of use and communication. This regularly includes the IP address, which is necessary to be able to deliver the contents of online offers to browsers, and all entries made within our online offer or from websites.

<strong>E-mail dispatch and hosting</strong>: The web hosting services we use also include the sending, receiving and storage of e-mails. For these purposes, the addresses of the recipients and senders as well as other information concerning the sending of e-mails (e.g. the providers involved) and the contents of the respective e-mails are processed. The aforementioned data may also be processed for the purpose of SPAM detection. Please note that e-mails on the Internet are generally not sent in encrypted form. As a rule, e-mails are encrypted in transit, but (unless an end-to-end encryption method is used) not on the servers from which they are sent and received. We can therefore not assume any responsibility for the transmission path of the e-mails between the sender and the reception on our server.

<strong>Collection of access data and log files</strong>: We ourselves (or our web hosting provider) collect data on every access to the server (so-called server log files). Server log files may include the address and name of the web pages and files accessed, date and time of access, data volume transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider.

The server log files can be used for security purposes, e.g. to avoid overloading the servers (especially in the case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and to ensure the capacity utilisation of the servers and their stability.

<h2 id="m17">Newsletter and electronic notifications</h2>
We send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications (hereinafter referred to as "newsletters") only with the consent of the recipients or a legal permission. If the contents of the newsletter are specifically described in the context of a registration for the newsletter, they are decisive for the consent of the users. Furthermore, our newsletters contain information about our services and us.

To register for our newsletters, it is generally sufficient to provide your e-mail address. However, we may ask you to provide a name for the purpose of personal contact in the newsletter, or other details if these are necessary for the purposes of the newsletter.

<strong>Double opt-in procedure:</strong> The registration for our newsletter is always done in a so-called double opt-in procedure. This means that after registration you will receive an e-mail asking you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that nobody can register with foreign e-mail addresses. The newsletter registrations are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process in accordance with the legal requirements. This includes the storage of the registration and confirmation time as well as the IP address. Changes to your data stored by the shipping service provider are also logged.

<strong>Deletion and limitation of processing: </strong> We may store the unsubscribed e-mail addresses for up to three years on the basis of our legitimate interests before we delete them in order to be able to prove a previously given consent. The processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a possible defence against claims. An individual request for deletion is possible at any time, provided that the former existence of a consent is confirmed at the same time. In case of obligations to permanently observe contradictions, we reserve the right to store the e-mail address in a blacklist for this purpose alone.

The logging of the registration procedure is based on our legitimate interests for the purpose of proving that it has been carried out properly. If we commission a service provider to send e-mails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure sending system.

<strong>Notes on legal bases:</strong> The sending of newsletters is based on the consent of the recipients or, if consent is not required, on our legitimate interests in direct marketing, if and to the extent permitted by law, e.g. in the case of existing customer advertising. If we commission a service provider to send e-mails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests. The registration process is recorded on the basis of our legitimate interests in order to prove that it was carried out in accordance with the law.

<strong>Content:</strong> Information about us, our services, actions and offers.

<strong>Analysis and performance measurement</strong>: The newsletters contain a so-called "web beacon", i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server when the newsletter is opened, or, if we use a mailing service provider, from their server. Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information such as information on the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and the time of the retrieval, is initially collected.

This information is used for the technical improvement of our newsletter based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behaviour on the basis of their retrieval locations (which can be determined by means of the IP address) or the access times. This analysis also includes determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our intention nor, if used, that of the mailing service provider to observe individual users. Rather, the evaluations serve us to recognise the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.

The evaluation of the newsletter and the measurement of success are carried out, subject to the express consent of the users, on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of using a user-friendly and secure newsletter system that serves our business interests and meets the expectations of the users.

A separate revocation of the performance measurement is unfortunately not possible. In this case, the entire newsletter subscription must be cancelled or objected to.

<h2 id="m263">Web analysis, monitoring and optimization</h2>
Web analysis (also known as "reach measurement") is used to evaluate the streams of visitors to our online offering and may include behavior, interests or demographic information about visitors, such as age or gender, as pseudonymous values. With the help of the range analysis we can, for example, identify at what time our online offer or its functions or contents are most frequently used or invite reuse. We can also understand which areas require optimization.

In addition to web analysis, we can also use test procedures, e.g. to test and optimise different versions of our online offer or its components.

For these purposes, so-called user profiles can be created and stored in a file (so-called "cookie") or similar procedures with the same purpose can be used. This information may include, for example, content viewed, web pages visited and elements used on those pages, and technical details such as the browser used, the computer system used and information on usage times. If users have consented to the collection of their location data, this data may also be processed, depending on the provider.

The IP addresses of users are also stored. However, we use an IP masking procedure (i.e., pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect the users. In general, the data stored in the context of web analysis, A/B testing and optimization are not clear user data (such as e-mail addresses or names), but pseudonyms. This means that we as well as the providers of the software used do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles for the purposes of the respective procedures.

<strong>Notes on legal bases:</strong> If we ask the users for their consent to the use of the third party providers, the legal basis for the processing of data is the consent. Otherwise, the users' data will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economic and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to draw your attention to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.

<h2 id="m264">Online marketing</h2>
We process personal data for online marketing purposes, which may include, in particular, the marketing of advertising space or the display of advertising and other content (collectively referred to as "Content") based on the potential interests of users and the measurement of its effectiveness.

For these purposes, so-called user profiles are created and stored in a file (so-called "cookie") or similar procedures are used, by means of which the user data relevant to the presentation of the aforementioned contents are stored. This information may include, for example, the content viewed, web pages visited, online networks used, but also communication partners and technical details such as the browser used, the computer system used and information on usage times. If users have consented to the collection of their location data, this data may also be processed.

The IP addresses of users are also stored. However, we use available IP masking procedures (i.e., pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect the users. In general, no clear user data (such as e-mail addresses or names) are stored in the context of the online marketing process, but pseudonyms. This means that we as well as the providers of the online marketing procedures do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles.

As a rule, the information in the profiles is stored in the cookies or by means of similar procedures. These cookies can later be read out and analysed for the purpose of presenting content on other websites that use the same online marketing procedure, and can also be supplemented with additional data and stored on the server of the online marketing procedure provider.

As an exception, clear data can be assigned to the profiles. This is the case, for example, if the users are members of a social network whose online marketing procedure we use and the network links the user profiles with the aforementioned data. Please note that users can make additional agreements with the providers, e.g. by giving their consent during registration.

As a matter of principle, we only obtain access to summarised information on the success of our advertisements. However, in the context of so-called conversion measurements, we can check which of our online marketing procedures have led to a so-called conversion, i.e., for example, to the conclusion of a contract with us. The conversion measurement is used solely to analyse the success of our marketing measures.

Unless otherwise stated, we ask you to assume that cookies used are stored for a period of two years.

<strong>Notes on legal bases:</strong> If we ask the users for their consent to the use of the third party providers, the legal basis for the processing of data is the consent. Otherwise, the users' data will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economic and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to draw your attention to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.

<strong>Facebook pixels</strong>: On the one hand, the Facebook pixel enables Facebook to determine the visitors of our online offer as a target group for the presentation of ads (so-called "Facebook ads"). Accordingly, we use the Facebook Pixel to display the Facebook Ads placed by us only to those users on Facebook and within the services of partners cooperating with Facebook (so-called "Audience Network" <a href="https://www.facebook.com/audiencenetwork/">https://www.facebook.com/audiencenetwork/</a> ) who have also shown an interest in our online offering or who exhibit certain characteristics (e.g. interest in certain topics or products that can be seen from the websites visited) that we transmit to Facebook (so-called "Custom Audiences"). With the help of the Facebook pixel, we also want to ensure that our Facebook Ads correspond to the potential interest of the users and do not appear annoying. The Facebook Pixel also enables us to track the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by seeing whether users have been redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (so-called "conversion measurement").

We also measure the conversion of the ads. However, we only learn the anonymous total number of users who clicked on our ad and were redirected to a page with a so-called "conversion tracking tag". We do not receive any information that can be used to identify users.

 	<li><strong>Google Ad Manager:</strong> We use the "Google Marketing Platform" (and services such as "Google Ad Manager") to place ads on the Google advertising network (e.g., in search results, in videos, on web pages, etc.).

This allows us to better target ads for and within our online offering to show users only ads that potentially match their interests. For example, if a user is shown ads for products that he or she has been interested in on other websites, this is called "remarketing".

<h2 id="m136">Presence in social networks (social media)</h2>
We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context in order to communicate with the users active there or to offer information about us.

Please note that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This can result in risks for the users, because the enforcement of the users' rights could be made more difficult.

Furthermore, user data within social networks are usually processed for market research and advertising purposes. Thus, for example, user profiles can be created on the basis of user behaviour and the resulting interests of the users. The user profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the users' computers, in which the usage behaviour and interests of the users are stored. Furthermore, data may also be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them).

For a detailed description of the respective forms of processing and the possibilities of objection (opt-out), we refer to the data protection declarations and information provided by the operators of the respective networks.

Also in the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights, we point out that these can be most effectively asserted with the providers. Only the providers have access to the data of the users in each case and can directly take appropriate measures and provide information. Should you nevertheless require assistance, you can contact us.

<h2 id="m328">Plugins and embedded functions and content</h2>
We include in our online offer functional and content elements that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third party providers"). These can be, for example, graphics, videos or social media buttons and contributions (hereinafter referred to uniformly as "content").

The integration always presupposes that the third party providers of these contents process the IP address of the users, as without the IP address they would not be able to send the contents to their browsers. The IP address is therefore required for the display of these contents or functions. We make every effort to use only such content whose respective providers use the IP address only to deliver the content. Third party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain technical information about the browser and operating system, the websites to be linked, the time of visit and other details about the use of our online offer, as well as being linked to such information from other sources.

<strong>Notes on legal bases:</strong> If we ask the users for their consent to the use of the third party providers, the legal basis for the processing of data is the consent. Otherwise, the users' data will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economic and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to draw your attention to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.

<h2 id="m12">Deletion of data</h2>
The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal requirements as soon as their consent permitted for processing is revoked or other permissions cease to apply (e.g. if the purpose for which the data were processed ceases to apply or if they are not necessary for the purpose).

Unless the data are deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing is limited to these purposes. This means that the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law or that must be stored for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims or protecting the rights of another natural or legal person.

Further information on the deletion of personal data can also be provided in the individual data protection notes of this data protection declaration.
<h2 id="m15">Amendment and update of the privacy policy</h2>
We ask you to inform yourself regularly about the content of our data protection declaration. We will adapt the data protection declaration as soon as changes in the data processing carried out by us make this necessary. We will inform you as soon as the changes make it necessary for you to take action to cooperate (e.g. to give your consent) or to receive other individual notification.

If we provide addresses and contact information of companies and organisations in this privacy policy, please note that the addresses may change over time and please check the information before contacting us.

As data subjects, you are entitled to various rights under the GDPR, which result in particular from Art. 15 to 21 GDPR:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Right of objection: You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the processing of personal data relating to you which is carried out pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (e) or (f) DPA; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. If the personal data concerning you are processed for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such marketing, including profiling, insofar as it is linked to such direct marketing.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Right of withdrawal for consents:</strong> You have the right to revoke your consent at any time.</li>
 	<li><strong>Right of access to information:</strong> You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not data in question is being processed and to obtain information on such data, as well as further information and a copy of the data in accordance with legal requirements.</li>
 	<li><strong>Right of rectification:</strong> In accordance with the law, you have the right to request the completion of the data concerning you or the correction of incorrect data concerning you.</li>
 	<li><strong>Right of cancellation and limitation of processing:</strong> In accordance with the statutory provisions, you have the right to demand that data concerning you be deleted immediately, or alternatively, in accordance with the statutory provisions, to demand that the processing of the data be restricted.</li>

 	<li><strong>Complaint to the supervisory authority:</strong> You also have the right, in accordance with the statutory provisions, to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of suspected infringement, if you believe that the processing of personal data concerning you is in breach of the GDPR.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="m42">Definitions of terms</h2>
This section provides an overview of the terms used in this privacy policy. Many of the terms are taken from the law and are defined above all in Art. 4 GDPR. The legal definitions are binding. The following explanations, on the other hand, are primarily intended to help you understand them. The terms are sorted alphabetically.
<ul class="glossary">
 	<li><strong>Conversion Tracking:</strong> "Conversion Tracking" means a procedure to determine the effectiveness of marketing activities. For this purpose, a cookie is usually stored on the user's devices within the websites on which the marketing measures are carried out and then retrieved again on the target website. For example, we can use this to track whether the ads we have placed on other websites have been successful).</li>
 	<li><strong>Credit rating information:</strong> Automated decisions are based on automatic data processing without human intervention (e.g. in the case of an automatic rejection of a purchase on account, an online credit application or an online application procedure without any human intervention. According to Art. 22 DPA, such automated decisions are only permissible if data subjects give their consent, if they are necessary for the performance of a contract or if national laws permit such decisions.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cross-Device Tracking:</strong> Cross-device tracking is a form of tracking in which the behavioral and interest information of users is recorded across devices in so-called profiles by assigning users an online identifier. This allows the user information to be analyzed for marketing purposes, regardless of the browser or device used (e.g. mobile phones or desktop computers). With most providers, the online identification is not linked to clear data, such as names, postal or e-mail addresses.</li>
 	<li><strong>IP-Masking:</strong> IP masking is a method of deleting the last octet, i.e. the last two numbers of an IP address, so that the IP address can no longer be used to uniquely identify a person. IP masking is therefore a means of pseudonymising processing methods, especially in online marketing</li>
 	<li><strong>Interest based and behavioral marketing:</strong> One speaks of interest-based and/or behavioral marketing when the potential interests of users in advertisements and other content are predetermined as precisely as possible. This is done on the basis of information about their previous behaviour (e.g. visiting and staying on certain websites, buying behaviour or interaction with other users), which is stored in a so-called profile. As a rule, cookies are used for these purposes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Conversion measurement:</strong> Conversion measurement is a method to determine the effectiveness of marketing measures. For this purpose, a cookie is usually stored on the users' devices within the websites on which the marketing measures take place and then retrieved again on the target website. For example, this enables us to track whether the ads we have placed on other websites have been successful.</li>
 	<li><strong>Personal data:</strong> "personal data" shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as "data subject"); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (e.g. a cookie) or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person</li>
 	<li><strong>Profiling:</strong> Profiling is any automated processing of personal data that consists of using personal data to analyse, evaluate or predict certain personal aspects relating to a natural person (depending on the type of profiling, this may include information on age, gender, location and movement data, interaction with websites and their content, shopping behaviour, social interactions with other people) (e.g. interests in certain content or products, click behaviour on a website or location). Cookies and web beacons are often used for profiling purposes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Range measurement:</strong> Reach measurement (also known as web analytics) is used to evaluate the flow of visitors to an online offering and can include the behaviour or interests of visitors in certain information, such as the content of websites. With the help of reach analysis, website owners can, for example, identify at what time visitors visit their website and what content they are interested in. This enables them to better adapt the contents of the website to the needs of their visitors. Pseudonymous cookies and web beacons are often used for the purpose of range analysis in order to recognise returning visitors and thus obtain more precise analyses of the use of an online offering.</li>
 	<li><strong>Remarketing:</strong> One speaks of "remarketing" or "retargeting", for example, when it is noted for advertising purposes which products a user was interested in on a website in order to remind the user of these products on other websites, e.g. in advertisements.</li>
 	<li><strong>Location data:</strong> Location data is created when a mobile device (or another device with the technical requirements for a location determination) connects to a radio cell, a WLAN or similar technical means and functions of location determination. Location data serve to indicate the geographically determinable position of the earth at which the respective device is located. Location data can be used, for example, to display map functions or other information dependent on a location.</li>
 	<li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Location data is created when a mobile device (or another device with the technical requirements for a location determination) connects to a radio cell, a WLAN or similar technical means and functions of location determination. As a rule, behavioral and interest information regarding the online offers used is stored in cookies or on servers of the providers of the tracking technologies (so-called profiling). This information can then be used, for example, to display advertisements to users that are likely to match their interests.</li>
 	<li><strong>Responsible person:</strong> "Responsible person" shall mean the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data</li>
 	<li><strong>Processing:</strong>"Processing" means any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means. The term is broad and covers virtually all handling of data, whether it be collection, analysis, storage, transmission or deletion.</li>
 	<li><strong>Target group formation:</strong> One speaks of target group formation (or "custom audiences") when target groups are determined for advertising purposes, e.g. insertion of advertisements. For example, based on a user's interest in certain products or topics on the Internet, it can be concluded that this user is interested in advertisements for similar products or the online shop where he/she viewed the products. Lookalike Audiences" (or similar target groups) are, in turn, when the content deemed suitable is displayed to users whose profiles or interests presumably correspond to the users for whom the profiles were created. Cookies and web beacons are generally used to create custom audiences and lookalike audiences.</li>
